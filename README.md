# CAN-Spy

The ESP32 microcontroller does not only support a CAN 2.0 interface, there are also a lot of boards and especially some gaming handhelds out there which supports a nice display, some buttons and a mobile LiPo power supply - so why not make an easy to use CAN tester out of it?

That is what CAN-Spy is for

In the samples folder there are different implementations, like for the ESPlay Micro (which is out of the ODroid Go family)
